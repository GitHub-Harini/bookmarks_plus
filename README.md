### About
Bookmarks+ displays the most frequent and most recently visited bookmarks based on userâ€™s frequency of visits to the bookmarked sites. If user keeps frequenting a different set of URLs over time, those URLs are auto-populated first in bookmarks+.

### POC
Visit https://github-harini.github.io/bookmarks_plus/ to view functionality. You can enter the URL, click on 'Go' to simulate visiting the page and '+' button to add page to bookmarks list. The frequency and recency (last accessed time) of the URLs are tracked only after the page is bookmarked.  

On population of the bookmarks list over time, you will view the frequent and recent bookmarks being populated under Bookmarks+. If bookmarks grow large, you will also get alert message to review and clear unused bookmarks.

The Bookmarks+ list is populated with most frequent URLs and the frequent URLs among the recent URLs (To know more: Refer the three tables below Bookmarks+)
